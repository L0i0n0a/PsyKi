  "finalPhaseDescription": "From now on, in addition to your own assessment, you will receive decision support from an automated system. This system analyzes the same images as you and provides its own assessment. To utilize both sources of information, you can use the so-called decision criterion ùëç. This combines your assessment with the system's ‚Äì weighted according to their reliability. Thus, both your assessment and the system's are incorporated into the decision proportionally. Depending on how reliable each source is, it will be weighted more or less strongly.\n\nüí° Note: The automated system has an average accuracy of 93%, and your own weighting has been calculated based on your performance in the test phase. You are free to decide whether and to what extent you want to use the system ‚Äì our goal is simply to show transparently how both assessments can be used to make an informed decision.",
