  "finalPhaseDescription": "From now on, in addition to your own assessment, you will receive decision support from an automated system. This system analyzes the same images as you and provides its own assessment. To utilize both sources of information, you can use the so-called decision criterion ùëç. This combines your assessment with the system's ‚Äì weighted according to their reliability. Thus, both your assessment and the system's are incorporated into the decision proportionally. Depending on how reliable each source is, it will be weighted more or less strongly.\n\nüí° Note: The automated system has an average accuracy of 93%, and your own weighting has been calculated based on your performance in the test phase. You are free to decide whether and to what extent you want to use the system ‚Äì our goal is simply to show transparently how both assessments can be used to make an informed decision.",

Your individual accuracy in the first phase was %GENAUIGKEIT%.\n\nIn the second part, we used a system that combined your judgments with those of an AI. The combination took into account how reliable each estimate was. The more accurate a source was ‚Äî whether you or the AI ‚Äî the more weight it was given. The accuracy with the help of the system was %GENAUIGKEIT%.\n\nThe goal of this strategy is to make better decisions together by combining human and machine input. Your participation helps us understand how decision support systems can be designed to support people meaningfully without overriding them.",
